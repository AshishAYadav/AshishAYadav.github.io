## Summary

I am a Full-Stack Developer with extensive experience in building robust and scalable applications. I specialize in working with modern web technologies such as Angular, React, and Node.js, as well as cloud technologies like AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes.

In my current role, I am working with JIO, developing IoT services and building microservices using RabbitMQ, MongoDB, and Node.js. I also have experience working with AWS services such as Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway, as well as deploying applications on Ubuntu servers with Nginx.

Prior to this, I worked at Hurix Systems where I developed PWA and Angular applications, utilizing technologies such as Workbox, IndexedDB, and Service Workers for offline capabilities. I also developed webhooks for assigning books on the Kitaboo platform from e-commerce websites, and created CLI tools to generate pre-rendered data for e-books. In addition, I worked on Electron.js and developed desktop applications for Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Strong experience in developing CLI projects for internal use and working on Angular and Vue.js front-end applications. Proficient in tools such as Docker, Linux (Ubuntu, Ubuntu Server), NGINX, APACHE2, Azure DevOps, Git, GitLab, nodemon, vite, npm, pm2, eslint, and webpack.

Overall, I am a passionate developer with a deep understanding of web technologies, cloud computing, and microservices architecture. I enjoy working on challenging projects and learning new technologies to stay ahead in this rapidly evolving field.
